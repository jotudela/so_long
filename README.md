# 🚀 INTRODUCTION

---

The `so_long` project at 42 school challenges students to create a mini game in C language.

Game's goal is very simple, you have a avatar that needs to recover items and exit with a portal to finish the game.

Leveraging the [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) library, this project seamlessly integrates graphics capabilities, providing students with a versatile toolset for creating visually stunning fractal representations.

MLX is a lightweight library designed for simple 2D graphics rendering, offering functions for creating windows, drawing pixels, and handling events like keyboard and mouse input.
